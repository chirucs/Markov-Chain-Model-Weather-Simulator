# Markov Chain Weather Simulator

A Python project that simulates weather patterns using a Markov chain model. The project predicts future weather conditions based on a set of predefined states (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy) and transition probabilities. It also visualizes the state transitions using a directed graph to better understand how the Markov chain evolves over time.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of Markov chains to model and simulate weather patterns. In a Markov chain, the next state depends only on the current state, making it a powerful tool for modeling systems that have memoryless transitions.

The simulator:
- Uses a transition matrix to define the probabilities of moving from one weather state to another.
- Generates a sequence of weather states over a specified number of days.
- Visualizes the state transitions with a directed graph, showing the probabilities of moving between weather states.

## Features
- Simulate weather patterns over a specified number of days.
- Visualize weather state transitions using a directed graph.
- Easily modify the transition matrix to explore different scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy networkx matplotlib

Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Markov-Chain-Weather-Simulator
Usage
Running the Simulation
Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or editor.
Run the Python script to simulate weather patterns:
bash
Copy code
python weather_simulator.py
The script will generate a sequence of weather states and display a directed graph of state transitions.
Modifying the Transition Matrix
You can adjust the transition probabilities in the script to simulate different weather scenarios. Ensure that each row of the transition matrix sums to 1.

How It Works
Markov Chain Model:
The project defines three weather states: Sunny, Rainy, and Cloudy.
A transition matrix specifies the probabilities of moving from one state to another.
Weather Simulation:
The simulation starts from a random weather state and uses the transition matrix to generate a sequence of weather states over a specified number of days.
Visualization:
The directed graph created using networkx shows the transition probabilities between weather states, providing a clear visual representation of the Markov chain.
Future Improvements
Add more weather states (e.g., Snowy, Windy) to make the simulation more realistic.
Use real historical weather data to estimate the transition matrix and simulate realistic weather patterns.
Implement a GUI to make the simulator more interactive.
